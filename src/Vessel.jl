### Input parameters:

* start: starting point given as a D tuple
* angles: D-1 tuple of angles for the vessel's direction (xy in 2D, xy and xz in 3D)
* diameter: starting diameter of vessel
* split_prob: probability for a splitting of the vessel into two vessel segments. Values between 0 and 1.
* change_prob: probability for directional change of the vessel route. Values between 0 and 1.
* max_change: max_change * pi specifies the maximum direction-change angle.
* splitnr: used for recursive call of the function. For the first call set it to 1. 
* max_number_splits: maximum number of splits of the vessel.
* stepsize: stepsize of the vessel.
* change_diameter_splitting: Indicates by how much the diameter decreases when the vessel splits
* split_prob_factor: Factor by which the split probability `split_prob` is multiplied when the vessel splits
* change_prob_increase: Increase of the change probability `change_prob` when the vessel splits
* steps_each_change: Number of steps for the change of the vessel direction
* steps_no_change: Number of steps for the case that the vessel does not change its direction
* rng: Random number generator
 
Output:
* route: A length N vector containing the D dimensional points of the route of the vessel. The 
length N depends on the random route.
* diameter_route: A length N vector containing the diameter of the vessel at the positions of the route.
